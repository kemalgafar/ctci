    Question 2.1: Remove Dups

    Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

    How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

    Question 2.2: Return Kth to Last

    Implement and algorithm to find the Kth to last element of a singly linked
    list.

    Question 2.3: Delete Middle Node

    Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked
    list, given only access to that node.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
    Result:  nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e

    Question 2.4: Partition

    Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
    less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is
    contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the
    elements less than x.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
    Output:  3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

    Question 2.5: Sum Lists

    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
    a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's
    digit is at the head of the linked list. Write a function that adds the two
    numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295
    Output:  2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912

    FOLLOW UP:

    Suppose the digits are stored in foward order. Repeat the above problem.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295
    Output:  9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912
