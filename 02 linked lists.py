    Question 2.1: Remove Dups

    Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

    How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

    Question 2.3: Delete Middle Node

    Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked
    list, given only access to that node.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
    Result:  nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e

    Question 2.4: Partition

    Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
    less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is
    contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the
    elements less than x.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
    Output:  3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

    Question 2.5: Sum Lists

    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
    a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's
    digit is at the head of the linked list. Write a function that adds the two
    numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295
    Output:  2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912

    FOLLOW UP:

    Suppose the digits are stored in foward order. Repeat the above problem.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295
    Output:  9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912

    Question 2.7: Intersection

    Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
    Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on
    reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is
    the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked
    list, then they are intersecting.

    Question 2.8: Loop Detection

    Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node
    at the beginning of the loop.

    DEFINITION:
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer
    points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

    EXAMPLE:

    Input:   A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
    Output:  C
