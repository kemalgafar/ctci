    Question 4.1: Route Between Nodes

    Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a
    route between two nodes.

    Question 4.2: Minimal Tree

    Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write
    an algorithm to create a binay search tree with minimal height.
    """

def quest_4_3():
    """
    Question 4.3: Lists of Depths

    Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all
    the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have
    D linked lists)
    """


def quest_4_4():
    """
    Question 4.4: Check Balanced

    Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes
    of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the
    heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

    Question 4.5: Validate BST

    Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

    Question 4.6: Successor

    Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a
    given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link
    to its parent.
