    Question 3.1: Three in One

    Describe how you could use a single array to impliment three stacks.

    Question 3.2: Stack Min

    How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a
    function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should
    all operate in O(1) time.

    Question 3.3: Stack of Plates

    Imagine, a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might
    topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the
    previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure
    SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several
    stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
    SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a
    single stack (that is. pop() should return the same values as it would if
    there were just a single stack).

    FOLLOW UP:

    Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a
    specific sub-stack.

    Question 3.4: Queue via Stacks

    Implement a MyQueue class which impliments a queue using two stacks.

def quest_3_5():
    """
    Question 3.5: Sort Stack

    Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
    You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements
    into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the
    following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
